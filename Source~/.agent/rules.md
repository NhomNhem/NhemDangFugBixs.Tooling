# Project Rules: NhemDangFugBixs.Tooling

## Source Generators

- **Incremental Generators**: Always inherit from `IIncrementalGenerator`. Avoid `ISourceGenerator` for better IDE performance.
- **Predicates**: The `predicate` in `CreateSyntaxProvider` must be extremely fast (syntax-only). Heavy analysis belongs in the `transform` phase.
- **Emitters**: Use `IndentedTextWriter` and the `Block` extension method for generating code to ensure consistency and readability.
- **Auto-generated Header**: All generated files must include the `// <auto-generated />` header.

## VContainer Integration

- **Registration Naming**: Methods in `VContainerRegistration` should follow the pattern `Register{ScopeName}`.
- **Attributes**: Use `[AutoRegister]` to mark classes for automatic DI registration.

## Agentic Workflows (`.agent/workflows/`)

- **Frontmatter**: Every workflow MUST have a YAML frontmatter with a `description` field.
- **H1 Headings**: Every workflow MUST have a clear `# Heading` immediately following the frontmatter to ensure IDE indexing and visibility.
- **Command Formatting**: Use plain text with `// turbo` annotations for executable commands. Avoid wrapping commands in backticks or code blocks if they are intended to be run automatically.
- **Index**: Keep the `workflow.md` index file updated with all available slash commands.
- **Visibility**: Ensure `.agent/` is NOT ignored by git if it contains shared project standards (or ensure the IDE is manually configured to index it).

## General

- **TargetFramework**: Keep at `net10.0` or higher for Tooling components where possible.
- **Nullability**: All projects must have `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`.
